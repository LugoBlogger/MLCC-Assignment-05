Our rule:
    Make it simple, efficient, reachable.

Starting from Sunday, March 22nd, 2020, every member should do any commit:
It can be comments, proposal, debug, or anything that you consider it
valuable to improve our project. Do it everyday to show that you
are active on making this project.

To make it simple, we will perform any prototypes and/or project 
in jupyter notebook. Only in complicated case(s), we put our code in script.
Please use heading any formatting style as we use to work with physical 
notebook.

We also record and write any progress everyday. If possible put the record 
in the a narative such that it will be easier to understand for other members.
This summary will be helpful when we are making slides.

Please revise this strategy if you find any better resolution.
