This file is to record our activities related to our participation in this project.



Log 21st March 2020 - Fatma:

Prior to 21st March, we formed this group that consists of Lugo, Nashrullah and Fatma

Then, Lugo created this repo and put some initial files for every member to read.
He also invited the other 2 group members to the repo as collaborators.

Fatma accepted the invitation. Record a screen activity on how to clone the repo and add a new file on it: try.py
she shared the recorded file to our telegram group chat so that other group members can learn the basic git flows.

I learnt how people use kernell on Kaggle

Then, I watched a youtube video about neural networks using Tensorflow
I followed along, using local computer to run the python code with tensorflow, matplotlib library.
Somehow it took awhile to run, thus I decided to move everything to google colab.

I keep my learning progress on my repo: https://github.com/fatjan/learn-tensorflow.git

It's really nice, I don't need to install any of these data science packages.

I also linked the colab file to that repo.

Now I think I know how to work on our project regardless of which dataset that we choose.

Some insights that I learnt:
tensorflow is great for using neural networks method of machine learning.
meaning that we need a lot of input data, but small amount of data can also be used accordingly, like 700-1000 nodes.

data science tools like tensorflow can ease us to create the model to make predictions. The part that we really need to be careful
is the data that we feed to our model.
Thus, data preparation is also quite important.
