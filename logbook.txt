Log 21st March 2020 - Fatma:

Prior to 21st March, we formed this group that consists of Lugo, Nashrullah and Fatma

Then, Lugo created this repo and put some initial files for every member to read.
He also invited the other 2 group members to the repo as collaborators.

Fatma accepted the invitation. Record a screen activity on how to clone the repo and add a new file on it: try.py
she shared the recorded file to our telegram group chat so that other group members can learn the basic git flows.
